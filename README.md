# bolt-java-sample-2
AWSClient.java is similar to the singleton that you reference in your java objects in order to read from S3. In addition to this, youâ€™ll find a  new singleton BoltClient.java (built on top of aws-sdk-java-2)that you can reference in your java objects to read from Bolt endpoint. Also included is App.java which shows an example of how a POJO can reference both Singletons. It first reads from Bolt and if that returns 404, it tries to read from S3.  I think most of your getObject calls to Lidar objects will look like this example.

 

In the pom file we are temporarily referencing a local path. We will update this once the jar is published later this week.
